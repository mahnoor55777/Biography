          <p> 21 November 1996) was a Pakistani theoretical physicist and a Nobel Prize laureate. 
            He shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics with Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg for his contribution to the 
            electroweak unification theory. He was the first Pakistani and the first from an Islamic country to receive 
            a Nobel Prize in science and the second from an Islamic country to receive any Nobel Prize, after Anwar Sadat of Egypt.</p>
          <p> Salam was scientific advisor to the Ministry of Science and Technology in Pakistan from 1960 to 1974, 
            a position from which he played a major and influential role in the development of the country's science infrastructure.
            Salam contributed to numerous developments in theoretical and particle physics in Pakistan. 
            He was the founding director of the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO), 
            and responsible for the establishment of the Theoretical Physics Group (TPG).For this, he is viewed as the 
            "scientific father"of this program. In 1974, Abdus Salam departed from his country, in protest, after the Parliament of 
            Pakistan passed unanimously a parliamentary bill declaring members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, to which Salam belonged, 
            non-Muslims. In 1998, following the country's Chagai-I nuclear tests, the Government of Pakistan issued a commemorative stamp, 
            as a part of "Scientists of Pakistan", to honour the services of Salam.</p>
            <p> Salam's notable achievements include the Pati-Salam model, magnetic photon, vector meson, Grand Unified Theory, 
              work on supersymmetry and, most importantly, electroweak theory, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize. 
              Salam made a major contribution in quantum field theory and in the advancement of Mathematics at Imperial College London. 
              With his student, Riazuddin, Salam made important contributions to the modern theory on neutrinos, neutron stars and black holes, 
              as well as the work on modernising quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. As a teacher and science promoter, 
              Salam is remembered as a founder and scientific father of mathematical and theoretical physics in Pakistan during his term 
              as the chief scientific advisor to the president.Salam heavily contributed to the rise of Pakistani physics within the 
              global physics community.Up until shortly before his death, Salam continued to contribute to physics, and to advocate for 
              the development of science in third-world countries.

          <p> Abdus Salam was born to Chaudhry Muhammad Hussain and Hajira Hussain in Jhang,into a Punjabi Muslim family that was part of
            the Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam. His grandfather, Gul Muhammad, was a religious scholar as well as a physician,

            <p> Salam very early established a reputation throughout Punjab and later at the University of Cambridge for outstanding 
              brilliance and academic achievement. At age 14, Salam scored the highest marks ever recorded for the matriculation 
              (entrance) examination at the Punjab University.He won a full scholarship to the Government College University of Lahore, 
              Punjab State, British India.Salam was a versatile scholar, interested in Urdu and English literature in which he excelled. 
              After a month in Lahore, he went to Bombay to Study. In 1947, he came back to Lahore. But he soon picked up Mathematics 
              as his concentration.Salam's mentor and tutors wanted him to become an English teacher, but Salam decided to stick 
              with Mathematics As a fourth-year student there, he published his work on Srinivasa Ramanujan's problems in mathematics, 
              and took his B.A. in Mathematics in 1944. </p>

            <p> His father wanted him to join the Indian Civil Service (ICS).In those days, the ICS was the highest aspiration for 
              young university graduates and civil servants occupied a respected place in civil society.Respecting his father's wish, 
              Salam tried for the Indian Railways but did not qualify for the service as he failed the medical optical tests. 
              The results further concluded that Salam failed a mechanical test required by railway engineers to gain a commission in 
              the Railways, and that he was too young to compete for the job.Therefore, the Railways rejected Salam's job application.
              While in Lahore, Salam went on to attend the graduate school of Government College University.
              He received his MA in Mathematics from the Government College University in 1946. </p>
              <p> That same year, he was awarded a scholarship to St John's College, Cambridge, where he completed a BA degree 
                with Double First-Class Honours in Mathematics and Physics in 1949. In 1950, he received the Smith's Prize from 
                Cambridge University for the most outstanding pre-doctoral contribution to Physics. After finishing his degrees, 
                Fred Hoyle advised Salam to spend another year in the Cavendish Laboratory to do research in experimental physics, 
                but Salam had no patience for carrying out long experiments in the laboratory.Salam returned to Jhang and renewed 
                his scholarship and returned to the United Kingdom to do his doctorate. </p>
                <p> He obtained a PhD degree in theoretical physics from the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge. 
                  His doctoral thesis titled "Developments in quantum theory of fields" contained comprehensive and fundamental 
                  work in quantum electrodynamics.By the time it was published in 1951, it had already gained him an 
                  international reputation and the Adams Prize.During his doctoral studies, his mentors challenged him to solve 
                  within one year an intractable problem which had defied such great minds as Paul Dirac and Richard Feynman.
                  Within six months, Salam had found a solution for the renormalization of meson theory. As he proposed the solution 
                  at the Cavendish Laboratory, Salam had attracted the attention of Hans Bethe, J. Robert Oppenheimer and Dirac. </p>

        <h2> Academic Career </h2>
        <div class="box">
            <p> After receiving his doctorate in 1951, Salam returned to Lahore at the Government College University as a Professor of 
              Mathematics where he remained till 1954. In 1952, he was appointed professor and Chair of the Department of Mathematics at 
              the neighbouring University of the Punjab. In the latter capacity, Salam sought to update the university curriculum, 
              introducing a course in Quantum mechanics as a part of the undergraduate curriculum.However, this initiative was soon 
              reverted by the Vice-Chancellor, and Salam decided to teach an evening course in Quantum Mechanics outside the 
              regular curriculum.While Salam enjoyed a mixed popularity in the university, he began to supervise the education of 
              students who were particularly influenced by him. As a result, Riazuddin remained the only student of Salam who had 
              the privilege to study under Salam at the undergraduate and post-graduate level in Lahore, and post-doctoral level in 
              Cambridge University. In 1953, Salam was unable to establish a research institute in Lahore, as he faced strong opposition 
              from his peers. In 1954, Salam took fellowship and became one of the earliest fellows of the Pakistan Academy of Sciences. 
              As a result of 1953 Lahore riots, Salam went back to Cambridge and joined St John's College, and took a position as 
              a professor of mathematics in 1954.In 1957, he was invited to take a chair at Imperial College, London, and 
              he and Paul Matthews went on to set up the Theoretical Physics Department at Imperial College. As time passed, 
              this department became one of the prestigious research departments that included well known physicists such as Steven Weinberg,
               Tom Kibble, Gerald Guralnik, C. R. Hagen, Riazuddin, and John Ward. </p>
               <p> In 1957, Punjab University conferred Salam with an Honorary doctorate for his contribution in Particle physics. 
                The same year with help from his mentor, Salam launched a scholarship programme for his students in Pakistan. 
                Salam retained strong links with Pakistan, and visited his country from time to time.At Cambridge and Imperial College 
                he formed a group of theoretical physicists, the majority of whom were his Pakistani students. At age 33, 
                Salam became one of the youngest persons to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1959. 
                Salam took a fellowship at the Princeton University in 1959, where he met with J. Robert Oppenheimer and to whom 
                he presented his research work on neutrinos. Oppenheimer and Salam discussed the foundation of electrodynamics, 
                problems and their solution.His dedicated personal assistant was Jean Bouckley. In 1980, Salam became a foreign 
                fellow of the Bangladesh Academy of Sciences. </p>

          <h2> Scientific Career </h2>
          <div class="box">
            <p> Early in his career, Salam made an important and significant contribution in quantum electrodynamics and quantum field theory, 
              including its extension into particle and nuclear physics. In his early career in Pakistan,
              Salam was greatly interested in mathematical series and their relation to physics. Salam had played an influential role
              in the advancement of nuclear physics, but he maintained and dedicated himself to mathematics and theoretical physics and 
              focused Pakistan to do more research in theoretical physics. However, he regarded nuclear physics 
              (nuclear fission and nuclear power) as a non-pioneering part of physics as it had already "happened". 
              Even in Pakistan, Salam was the leading driving force in theoretical physics, with many scientists he continued to 
              influence and encourage to keep their work on theoretical physics. </p>

              
              <p> Salam had a prolific research career in theoretical and high-energy physics. 
                Salam had worked on theory of the neutrino - an elusive particle that was first postulated by Wolfgang Pauli in the 1930s. 
                Salam introduced chiral symmetry in the theory of neutrinos. The introduction of chiral symmetry played crucial role 
                in subsequent development of the theory of electroweak interactions. Salam later passed his work to Riazuddin,
                who made pioneering contributions in neutrinos. Salam introduced the massive Higgs bosons to the theory of the 
                 Standard Model, where he later predicted the existence of proton decay. In 1963, Salam published his theoretical 
                 work on the vector meson. The paper introduced the interaction of vector meson, photon (vector electrodynamics), 
                 and the renormalisation of vector mesons' known mass after the interaction. In 1961, Salam began to work with 
                 John Clive Ward on symmetries and electroweak unification. In 1964, Salam and Ward worked on a Gauge theory 
                 for the weak and electromagnetic interaction, subsequently obtaining SU(2) × U(1) model. Salam was convinced 
                 that all the elementary particle interactions are actually the gauge interactions. In 1968, together with 
                 Weinberg and Sheldon Glashow, Salam formulated the mathematical concept of their work. While in Imperial College, 
                 Salam, along with Glashow and Jeffrey Goldstone, mathematically proved the Goldstone's theorem, that a 
                 massless spin-zero object must appear in a theory as a result of spontaneous breaking of a continuous global symmetry. 
                 In 1967-8, Salam and Weinberg incorporated the Higgs mechanism into Glashow's discovery, giving it a modern form 
                 in electroweak theory, and thus theorised half of the Standard Model. In 1968, together with Weinberg and 
                 Sheldon Glashow, Salam finally formulated the mathematical concept of their work. </p>
                 
                 <p> In 1966, Salam carried out pioneering work on a hypothetical particle. Salam showed the possible electromagnetic 
                  interaction between the Magnetic monopole and the C-violation, thus he formulated the magnetic photon. </p>
                  
                  <p> Following the publication of PRL Symmetry Breaking papers in 1964, Steven Weinberg and Salam were the first to 
                    apply the Higgs mechanism to electroweak symmetry breaking. Salam provided a mathematical postulation for the 
                    interaction between the Higgs boson and the electroweak symmetry theory. </p>

                <p> In 1972, Salam began to work with Indian-American theoretical physicist Jogesh Pati. Pati wrote to 
                  Salam several times expressing interest to work under Salam's direction, in response to which Salam eventually 
                  invited Pati to the ICTP seminar in Pakistan. Salam suggested to Pati that there should be some deep reason why 
                  the protons and electrons are so different and yet carry equal but opposite electric charge.
                  Protons are composed of quarks, but the electroweak theory was concerned only with the electrons and neutrinos, 
                  with nothing postulated about quarks. If all of nature's ingredients could be brought together in one new symmetry, 
                  it might reveal a reason for the various features of these particles and the forces they feel. 
                  This led to the development of Pati-Salam model in particle physics. In 1973, Salam and Jogesh Pati 
                  were the first to notice that since Quarks and Leptons have very similar SU(2) × U(1) representation content, 
                  they all may have similar entities. They provided a simple realisation of the quark-lepton symmetry by 
                  postulating that lepton number was a fourth quark colour, dubbed "violet". </p>

                <p> Physicists had believed that there were four fundamental forces of nature: the gravitational force, 
              the strong and weak nuclear forces, and the electromagnetic force.Salam had worked on the unification of these 
              forces from 1959 with Glashow and Weinberg. While at Imperial College London, Salam successfully showed that weak 
              nuclear forces are not really different from electromagnetic forces, and two could inter-convert.
              Salam provided a theory that shows the unification of two fundamental forces of nature, weak nuclear forces and 
              the electromagnetic forces, one into another. Glashow had also formulated the same work, and the theory 
              was combined in 1966. In 1967, Salam proved the electroweak unification theory mathematically, 
              and finally published the papers. For this achievement, Salam, Glashow, and Weinberg were awarded the 
              Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979. The Nobel Prize Foundation paid tribute to the scientists and issued 
              a statement saying: "For their contributions to the theory of the unified weak and electromagnetic interaction 
              between elementary particles, including, inter alia, the prediction of the weak neutral current". 
              Salam took the Nobel Prize medal to the house of his former professor, Anilendra Ganguly, who taught him 
              at the Sanatan Dharma College in Lahore, and placed the medal around his neck, stating "Mr Anilendra Ganguly 
              this medal is a result of your teaching and love of mathematics that you instilled in me". 
              In the 1970s Salam continued trying to unify forces by including the strong interaction in a grand unified theory.</p>

                 <p> Abdus Salam returned to Pakistan in 1960 to take charge of a government post given to him by President Ayub Khan. 
                   From her independence in 1947 after the Partition of India, Pakistan has never had a coherent science policy, 
                   and total expenditure on research and development was only ~1.0% of Pakistan's GDP. Even the Pakistan Atomic Energy 
                   Commission headquarters was located in a small room, and less than 10 scientists were working on fundamental 
                   physics concepts. Salam replaced Salimuzzaman Siddiqui as the Science Advisor,
                   and became first Member (technical) of PAEC. </p>

              <p> Salam expanded the web of physics research and development in Pakistan by sending more than 500 scientists abroad. 
                In 1961 he approached President Khan to set up the country's first national space agency, thus on 16 September 1961 
                the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission was established, with Salam as its first director. Before 1960, 
                very little work on scientific development was done, and scientific activities in Pakistan were almost diminished.
                [clarify] Salam called Ishfaq Ahmad, a nuclear physicist, who had left for Switzerland where he joined CERN,
                back to Pakistan. With the support of Salam, PAEC established PAEC Lahore Center-6, with Ishfaq Ahmad as 
                its first director. In 1967, Salam became a central and administrative figure to lead the research in Theoretical 
                and Particle physics. With the establishment of the Institute of Physics at Quaid-e-Azam University, research 
                in theoretical and particle physics was engaged. Under Salam's direction, physicists tackled the greatest 
                outstanding problems in physics and mathematics and their physics research reached a point that prompted 
                worldwide recognition of Pakistani physicists. </p>

                <p> From the 1950s, Salam had tried establishing high-powered research institutes in Pakistan, 
                  though he was unable to do so. He moved PAEC Headquarters to a bigger building, and established research 
                  laboratories all over the country. On the direction of Salam, Ishrat Hussain Usmani set up plutonium and 
                  uranium exploration committees throughout the country. In October 1961, Salam travelled to the United States 
                  and signed a space co-operation agreement between Pakistan and US. In November 1961, the US National Aeronautics 
                  and Space Administration (NASA) started to build a space facility - Flight Test Center (FTC) - at Sonmiani, 
                  a coastal town in Balochistan Province. Salam served as its first technical director. </p>
                 <p> Salam played an influential and significant role in Pakistan's development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. 
                   In 1964, he was made head of Pakistan's IAEA delegation and represented Pakistan for a decade. </p>

            <div class="box">
              <p> The same year, Salam joined Munir Ahmad Khan - his lifelong friend and contemporary at Government College University. 
                Khan was the first person in the IAEA that Salam had consulted about the establishment of the International Centre for 
                Theoretical Physics (ICTP), a research physics institution, in Trieste, Italy. With an agreement signed with IAEA, 
                the ICTP was set up with Salam as its first director. At IAEA, Salam had advocated the importance of nuclear 
                power plants in his country. It was due to his effort that in 1965, Canada and Pakistan signed a nuclear 
                energy co-operation deal. Salam obtained permission from President Ayub Khan - against the wishes of his own 
                government functionaries - to set up the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant. Also in 1965, led by Salam, 
                the United States and Pakistan signed an agreement in which the US provided Pakistan with a small research reactor 
                (PARR-I). Salam had a long-held dream to establish a research institute in Pakistan, which he had advocated 
                for on many occasions. In 1965 again, Salam and architect Edward Durell Stone signed a contract for the establishment 
                of the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology (PINSTECH) at Nilore, Islamabad. </p>

            <h2> Space Programme </h2>
            <div class="box">
              <p> In early 1961, Salam approached President Khan to lay the foundations of Pakistan's first executive agency to 
                co-ordinate space research. By executive order on 16 September 1961 the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission 
                (SUPARCO) was established with Salam founding director. Salam immediately travelled to the United States, 
                where he signed a space co-operation agreement with the US Government. In November 1961, NASA built the Flight Test Center 
                in Balochistan Province. During this time, Salam visited the Pakistan Air Force Academy where he met with Air Commodore 
                (Brigadier-General) Wladyslaw Turowicz - a Polish military scientist and an aerospace engineer. Turowicz was made 
                the first technical director of the space centre, and a programme of rocket testing ensued. In 1964, while in the US 
                Salam visited the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and met with nuclear engineers Salim Mehmud and Tariq Mustafa. 
                Salam signed another agreement with the NASA which launched a programme to provide training to Pakistan's scientists 
                and engineers. Both nuclear engineers returned to Pakistan and were inducted into SUPARCO. </p>

            <h2> Nuclear Weapons Programme </h2>
            <div class="box">
              <p>
                Salam knew the importance of nuclear technology in Pakistan, for civilian and peaceful purposes. But, according to 
                his biographers, Salam played an ambiguous role in Pakistan's own atomic bomb project. As late as the 1960s, 
                Salam made an unsuccessful proposal for the establishment of a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant, but it was deferred on 
                economic grounds by Ayub Khan. According to Rehman, Salam's influence in nuclear development was diminished as 
                late as 1974, and he became critical of Bhutto's control over science. But Salam personally did not terminate his 
                connection with the scientists working in the theoretical physics division at PAEC. As early as 1972-73, he had been 
                a great advocate for the atomic bomb project, but subsequently took a stance against it after he fell out with Bhutto 
                over the Second Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan which declared the Ahmaddiya denomination to be non-Islamic.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1965, Salam led the establishing of the nuclear research institute—PINSTECH. In 1965, the plutonium Pakistan 
                Atomic Research Reactor (PARR-I) went critical under Salams' leadership. In 1973, Salam proposed the idea of 
                establishing an annual college to promote scientific activities in the country to the Chairman of PAEC, Munir Khan, 
                who accepted and fully supported the idea. This led to the establishment of the International Nathiagali Summer College 
                on Physics and Contemporary Needs (INSC), where each year since 1976 scientists from all over the world come to Pakistan to 
                interact with local scientists. The first annual INSC conference was held on advanced particle and nuclear physics.
              </p>
              <p>
                In November 1971, Salam met with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in his residence, and following Bhutto's advice, went to the 
                United States to avoid the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Salam travelled to the US and returned to Pakistan with 
                scientific literature about the Manhattan Project, and calculations involving atomic bombs. In 1972, 
                the Government of Pakistan learned about the development status of the first atomic bomb completed under the Indian 
                nuclear programme. On 20 January 1972, Salam, as Science Advisor to the President of Pakistan, managed and participated 
                in a secret meeting of nuclear scientists with former Prime Minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in Multan, known as 
                the 'Multan Meeting'. At this meeting Bhutto orchestrated the development of a deterrence programme. 
                At the meeting, only I. H. Usmani protested, believing that the country had neither the facilities or talent to 
                carry out such an ambitious and technologically remanding project, whilst Salam remained quiet. Here, Bhutto entrusted 
                Salam and appointed Munir Khan as Chairman of PAEC, and head of the atomic bomb program, as Salam had supported Khan.
                A few months after the meeting, Salam, Khan, and Riazuddin, met with Bhutto in his residence where the scientists 
                briefed him about the nuclear weapons program. After the meeting, Salam established the 'Theoretical Physics Group' 
                (TPG) in PAEC. Salam led groundbreaking work at TPG until 1974.
              </p>
              <p>
                An office was set up for Salam in the Prime Ministers' Secretariat by order of Bhutto. Salam immediately started 
                to motivate and invite scientists to begin work with PAEC in the development of fission weapons. In December 1972, 
                two theoretical physicists working at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics were asked by Salam to report 
                to Munir Ahmad Khan, the scientific director of the program. This marked the beginning of the TPG, reporting directly 
                to Salam. The TPG, in PAEC, was assigned to conduct research in fast neutron calculations, hydrodynamics 
                (how the explosion produced by a chain reaction might behave), problems of neutron diffusion, and the development 
                of theoretical designs of Pakistan's nuclear weapon devices. Later, the TPG under Riazuddin began to directly 
                report to Salam, and the work on the theoretical design of the nuclear weapon was completed in 1977. In 1972, 
                Salam formed the Mathematical Physics Group, under Raziuddin Siddiqui, that was charged, with TPG, with carrying out 
                research in the theory of simultaneity during the detonation process, and the mathematics involved in the theory of 
                nuclear fission. Following India's surprise nuclear test —Pokhran-I - in 1974, Munir Ahmad Khan had called a meeting 
                to initiate work on an atomic bomb. Salam was there and Muhammad Hafeez Qureshi was appointed head of the Directorate of 
                Technical Development (DTD) in PAEC.
              </p>
              <p>
                The DTD was set up to co-ordinate the work of the various specialised groups of scientists and engineers working on 
                different aspects of the atomic bomb. The word "bomb" was never used in this meeting, but the participants fully 
                understood what was being discussed. In March 1974, Salam and Khan also established the Wah Group Scientist that 
                was charged with manufacturing materials, explosive lenses and triggering mechanism development of the weapon. 
                Following the setting up of DTD, Salam, Riazuddin and Munir Ahmad Khan, visited the Pakistan Ordnance Factories (POF) where 
                they held talks with senior military engineers led by POF chairman Lieutenant-General Qamar Ali Mirza. 
                It was there that the Corps of Engineers built the Metallurgical Laboratory in Wah Cantonment in 1976.
                Salam remained associated with the nuclear weapons programme until mid-1974, when he left the country after Ahmadi 
                were declared non-Muslims by the Pakistani Parliament. His own relations with Prime minister Bhutto fell out and 
                turned into open hostility after the Ahmadiyya Community was declared as not-Islamic; he lodged a public and powerful 
                protest against Bhutto regarding this issue and gave great criticism to Bhutto over his control over science. 
                In spite of this, Salam maintained close relations with the theoretical physics division at PAEC who kept him informed 
                about the status of the calculations needed to calculate the performance of the atomic bomb, according to Norman Dombey.
                After seeing Indian aggression, the Siachen conflict in Northern Pakistan, followed by India's Operation Brasstacks 
                in Southern Pakistan, Salam again renewed his ties with senior scientists working in the atomic bomb projects, who had 
                kept him informed about the scientific development of the program. In the 1980s, Salam personally approved many 
                appointments and a large influx of Pakistani scientists to the associateship program at ICTP and CERN, and engaged in
                 research in theoretical physics with his students at the ICTP.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2008, Indian scholar Ravi Singh noted in his book The Military Factor in Pakistan that, "in 1978, Abdus Salam 
                with PAEC officials, paid a secret visit to China, and was instrumental in initiating industrial nuclear cooperation 
                between the two countries." Although he had left the country, Salam did not hesitate to advise the PAEC and 
                Theoretical and Mathematical Physics Group on important scientific matters, and kept his close association 
                with TPG and PAEC.

                  on physics and science. Even today, the INSC holds annual meetings, and Salam's pupil Riazuddin has been its director 
                  since its start.

                In 1997, the scientists at ICTP commemorated Salam and renamed ICTP as the "Abdus Salam International Centre for 
                Theoretical Physics". Throughout the years, he served on a number of United Nations committees concerning science and 
                technology in developing countries. Salam also founded the Third World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) and was a leading 
                figure in the creation of a number of international centres dedicated to the advancement of science and technology.

                During a visit to the Institute of Physics at Quaid-i-Azam University in 1979, Salam explained after receiving an award: 
                Physicists believed there are four fundamental forces of nature; the gravitational force, the weak and strong nuclear force, 
                and the electromagnetic force.[relevant?] Salam was a firm believer that "scientific thought is the common heritage of 
                mankind", and that developing nations needed to help themselves, and invest in their own scientists to boost development 
                and reduce the gap between the Global South and the Global North, thus contributing to a more peaceful world.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1981, Salam became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.

              <p>
                Although Salam left Pakistan, he did not terminate his connection to home. He continued inviting Pakistan's scientists 
                to ICTP, and maintained a research programme for them. Many prominent scientists, including Ghulam Murtaza, Riazuddin, 
                Kamaluddin Ahmed, Faheem Hussain, Raziuddin Siddiqui, Munir Ahmad Khan, Ishfaq Ahmad, and I. H. Usmani, considered him as 
                their mentor and a teacher.

            <div class="box">
              <p> In 1949, age 23, Salam married his 22-year-old cousin Amtul Hafeez Hussain. The couple had three daughters and a son. 
                According to Islamic law, a man may have more than one wife. In November 1967, Salam married the biophysicist Louise Johnson, 
                with whom he had a son and a daughter. </p>
                <p> In 1974, Salam was saddened when Pakistan's government passed a law declaring Ahmadis to be non-Muslims. 
                  In 1980, after he received the Nobel Prize, he was invited as an honored guest to the Quaid-e-Azam University in 
                  Pakistan's capital city, Islamabad. The ceremony was cancelled because extremists threatened to break Salam's legs if 
                  he turned up at the university. </p>
                  <p> In the mid-1980s, Salam began suffering from a degenerative neurological disorder. 
                    Eventually he was confined to a wheelchair. He retired from his chair at Imperial College in 1994, age 68. </p>
                    <p> Abdus Salam died peacefully, age 70, at home in Oxford on November 21, 1996. He was buried four days later 
                      in the Ahmadi city of Rabwah, Pakistan. </p>
                      <p> He was survived by his children and his wives.

            <h2> Death </h2>
            <div class="box">
              <p>
                Abdus Salam died on 21 November 1996 at the age of 70 in Oxford, England, from progressive supranuclear palsy. 
                His body was returned to Pakistan and kept in Darul Ziafat, where some 13,000 men and women visited to pay their last respects. 
                Approximately 30,000 people attended his funeral prayers.
              <br>
                Salam was buried in Bahishti Maqbara, a cemetery established by the Ahmadiyya Community at Rabwah, Punjab, Pakistan, 
                next to his parents' graves. The epitaph on his tomb initially read "First Muslim Nobel Laureate". 
                The Pakistani government removed "Muslim" and left only his name on the headstone. They are the only nation to 
                officially declare that Ahmadis are non-Muslim. The word "Muslim" was initially obscured on the orders of a 
                local magistrate before moving to the national level. Under Ordinance XX of 1984, being an Ahmadi, he was considered 
                a non-Muslim according to the definition provided in the Second Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan.

            <div class="box">
              <p> Salam's work in Pakistan has been far reaching and regarded as highly influential. He is remembered by his peers and 
                students as the "father of Pakistan's school of Theoretical Physics" as well as Pakistan's science. Salam was a charismatic 
                and iconic figure, a symbol among them of what they were working or researching toward in their fields. His students, 
                fellow scientists and engineers, remembered him as brilliant teacher, and engaging researcher who would also influence 
                others to do the same.Salam founded the Space Research Commission of and was its first director. In 1998, 
                the Government of Pakistan issued a commemorative stamp to honour Salam as part of its "Scientists of Pakistan" series.
                 His alma mater, Government College Lahore, now a university, has the Abdus Salam Chair in Physics and Abdus Salam 
                 School of Mathematical Sciences named after him. The Abdus Salam Chair was also established in his honour at 
                 the Syed Babar Ali School of Science and Engineering in the Lahore University of Management Sciences. He made 
                 a significant contribution towards the 2012 success in the search for the Higgs boson. </p>
                 <p> Salam has been commemorated by noted and prominent Pakistani scientists, who were also his students. 
                  Many scientists have recalled their college experiences. Ghulam Murtaza, a professor of plasma physics at the 
                  Government College University and student of Salam, wrote: </p>

                    When Dr. Salam was to deliver a lecture, the hall would be packed and although the subject was Particle Physics, 
                    his manner and eloquence was such as if he was talking about literature. When he finished his lectures, 
                    listeners would often burst into spontaneous applause and give him a standing ovation. People from all parts 
                    of the world would come to Imperial College and seek Dr. Salam's help. He would give a patient hearing to everyone 
                    including those who were talking nonsense. He treated everyone with respect and compassion and never belittled or 
                    offended anyone. Dr. Salam's strength was that he could "sift jewels from the sand". </p>

                two years after the producers had conceived of the idea. A fundraising teaser was released by Kailoola Productions 
                to coincide with Salam's birth anniversary on 29 January 2017. The post-production phase of this documentary film, 
                pending funding, is estimated at US$150,000. The film Salam: The First ****** Nobel Laureate, directed by the

            <p> Salam was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1971, the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1979,
               and the American Philosophical Society in 1992.In 1997, scientists at ICTP renamed the institute as the 
               Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics in the honour of Salam. Salam's services have been recognised 
               in Pakistan, as his students have openly spoken and stressed the importance of Science and Technology in Pakistan. In 1999, 
               per the recommendation of Ishfaq Ahmad, the Government of Pakistan led the establishment of the Abdus Salam Chair in Physics 
               at the Government College University. On 22 November 2009, the Director of the Abdus Salam International Centre for 
               Theoretical Physics gifted the original Nobel Prize Certificate to his alma mater. In 2011, GCU's Salam Chair in 
               Physics held a one-day-long conference that was attributed to Abdus Salam. Salam's students Ghulam Murtaza, Pervez Hoodbhoy,
                Riazuddin and Tariq Zaidi discussed the life and works of Salam, and brought to light his achievements in Pakistan and Physics.

                <h2> Awards Named After Salam </h2>
                <p> The Abdus Salam Award (also called the Salam Prize) is an award established to recognise high achievements and 
                  contributions in physical and natural sciences. In 1979, Riazuddin, Fayyazuddin and Asghar Qadir met with Salam, 
                  and presented the idea of creating an award to appreciate scientists, resident in Pakistan, in their respective fields. 
                  Salam donated the money he had won as he felt that he had no right use for the prize money. It was endowed by 
                  Asghar Qadir, Riazuddin and Fayyazuddin in 1980, and it was first awarded in 1981. The winners are selected by a committee 
                  (consisted of Aghar Qadir, Fayyazuddin, Riazuddin, and others) of the Center for Advanced Mathematics and Physics (CAMP), 
                  which administers the award. The Abdus Salam Medal is presented by the Third World Academy of Sciences in Trieste, 
                  Italy. First given in 1995, the award is presented to the people who have served the cause of science in 
                  the Developing World. The Abdus Salam Shield of Honor in Mathematics was initiated by the National Mathematical 
                  Society of Pakistan to promote and recognize quality research in Mathematics in 2015. It was awarded for the first time 
                  in 2016. </p>
                <h2> Contributions </h2>  
                <p> Salam's primary focus was research on the physics of elementary particles.

                  <li> two-component neutrino theory and the prediction of the inevitable parity violation in weak interaction; </li>
                  <li> gauge unification of weak and electromagnetic interactions, the unified force is called the "Electroweak" force, 
                    a name given to it by Salam, and which forms the basis of the Standard Model in particle physics; </li>
                  <li> predicted the existence of weak neutral currents, and W and Z bosons, before their experimental discovery </li>
                  <li> symmetry properties of elementary particles; unitary symmetry; </li>
                  <li> renormalization of meson theories; </li>
                  <li> gravity theory and its role in particle physics; two tensor theory of gravity and strong interaction physics; </li>
                  <li> unification of electroweak with strong nuclear forces, grand unification theory; </li>
                  <li> related prediction of proton-decay; </li>
                  <li> Pati-Salam model, a grand unification theory; </li>
                  <li> Supersymmetry theory, in particular formulation of Superspace and formalism of superfields in 1974; </li>
                  <li> the theory of supermanifolds, as a geometrical framework for understanding supersymmetry, in 1974; </li>
                  <li> Supergeometry, the geometric basis for supersymmetry, in 1974; </li>
                  <li> application of the Higgs mechanism to 'electroweak symmetry breaking'; </li>
